    "background": "Bitcoin is a decentralized network for peer-to-peer value transfer created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Nakamoto first introduced the white paper for Bitcoin to a mailing list on October 31, 2008. Bitcoin borrows from nearly three decades of research by academics, cypherpunk practitioners, and hobbyists who tried to create similar payment protocols. Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, and e-gold.\n\nBitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the central tendency of political affiliations among early Bitcoin investors. Nakamoto included a now-famous The Times headline in Bitcoin’s genesis block coinbase to prove the network’s fair launch. Many bitcoiners misinterpret The Times headline as a signal of support to anyone seeking alternatives to legacy financial services and sovereign monies.",

      "description": "Mining blocks is the only way to mint new bitcoins. Block rewards (initially 50 BTC + transaction fees) are claimed every 10 minutes, on average. Block rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years).\n\nNakamoto created the first bitcoins on January 3, 2009 by mining the genesis block. The genesis block mining reward reward (50 BTC) is unspendable due to the original client's block database and transaction database configuration.\n\nBitcoin currently has a supply cap of 21 million coins. Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP) 42 introduced this finite supply monetary design as an adjustment to Nakamoto’s original supply modeled after 4 gold mines being discovered per mibillenium (1024 years), according to the BIP.\n\nAn inflation bug (CVE-2010-5139) created 184 billion bitcoins on August 15, 2010 at block height 74638. \n\n\n"
