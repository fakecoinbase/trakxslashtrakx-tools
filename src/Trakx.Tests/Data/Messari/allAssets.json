Bitcoin (BTC), the native asset of the Bitcoin blockchain, is the world's first digital currency without a central bank or administrator.

Bitcoin is the first, oldest, and largest cryptocurrency in the world.",
        "background": "Pre-history\nBitcoin borrows from nearly three decades of research by academics, cypherpunk practitioners, and hobbyists who tried to create similar payment protocols. Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. \n\nConception to Launch\nOn October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto\"\u003eSatoshi Nakamoto\u003c/a\u003e released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous \"The Times\" headline in the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction\"\u003ecoinbase\u003c/a\u003e both to prove the network’s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.\n\nPost Launch\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/hal-finney\"\u003eHal Finney\u003c/a\u003e, whom invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz\"\u003eLaszlo Hanyecz\u003c/a\u003e bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. \n\nIn August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nIn December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010, when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen\"\u003eGavin Andresen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSilk Road \u0026 Mt. Gox\nOne of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road’s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht\"\u003eRoss Ulbricht\u003c/a\u003e, and shuttering the site.\n\nFounded by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\"\u003eJed McCaleb\u003c/a\u003e in July 2010, and led by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles\"\u003eMark Karpeles\u003c/a\u003e until it collapsed, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/mtgox\"\u003eMt. Gox\u003c/a\u003e was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.\n\n2017 Bubble \u0026 Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nThe 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.\n\nAlso notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\"\u003emost contentious fork to date\u003c/a\u003e. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the \"New York Agreement\". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of the Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.\n\n2018 - Present\nAfter peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.\n\nSince it reached it's cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, it's highest intraday movement since 2011.\n",
        "technology": "\"Bitcoin\" is a label used for a protocol and a currency.\n\nBitcoin, the currency, is bits of data usable outside the limitations of the protocol using second layer solutions like \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/lightning-network\"\u003eLightning Network\u003c/a\u003e payment channels. \n\nBitcoin, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/utxo\"\u003eunspent transaction output\u003c/a\u003e (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 1MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\"\u003enodes\u003c/a\u003e maintains this ledger by validating, propagating, and fighting to include \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mempool\"\u003emempool\u003c/a\u003e transactions in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.\n\nMining difficulty regularly adjusts to maintain Bitcoin's average ten-minute block schedule. Mining nodes add new blocks to whatever chain has the largest accumulated proof of work maintained by a network of economic nodes with downloaded copies of the same chain.\n\nLearn More:\nBitcoin Developer's Guide\nMastering Bitcoin",

        "overview": "Ethereum is a distributed blockchain computing platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its native token is ether ($ETH), which primarily serves as a means of payment for transaction fees and as collateral for borrowing specific \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eERC-20\u003c/a\u003e tokens within the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-finance-defi\"\u003edecentralized finance (DeFi\u003c/a\u003e) sector.",
        "background": "Conception to token sale\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e conceived Ethereum in 2013, after what he perceived as limitations in the functionality of Bitcoin’s scripting language, namely the lack of Turing completeness. Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\"\u003eEthereum Foundation\u003c/a\u003e, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum’s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003e$BTC\u003c/a\u003e (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)\nEthereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly after, Augur (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/augur\"\u003e$REP\u003c/a\u003e) conducted the first \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003eInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eERC-20\u003c/a\u003e standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.\n\nThe DAO hack\nOf course, raising large sums of money on experimental technology comes with a high level of risk, and The DAO hack is an example of the potential consequences. In April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-dao\"\u003eThe DAO\u003c/a\u003e raised ~$150 million in ETH. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to reverse the transactions to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\"\u003e$ETC\u003c/a\u003e).\n\nThe path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0\nScalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum, and the community needs to address it if Ethereum intends to execute on its \"world computer\" vision. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017, tend to cripple the Ethereum network, causing transaction times and fees to skyrocket and posing an existential threat to a project seeking mainstream adoption. To address this issue, Vitalik Buterin and other community members promoted a future switch to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism featuring sharding, a theoretical scaling solution for blockchain networks. The proposed roadmap for the next version of Ethereum (dubbed Ethereum 2.0) includes these critical architectural changes, among others, to help provide a more suitable user and developer experience. Ethereum 2.0 is still in development with an anticipated launch in 2020.",
        "technology": "Ethereum is an account-based blockchain consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e and enable the programmability of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nThe heart of the Ethereum blockchain is known as the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\"\u003eEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u003c/a\u003e, which is the part of the protocol that executes transactions. It is a Turing complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.\n\nEthereum adopted \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eEthereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20\u003c/a\u003e in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake\u003c/a\u003e and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. However, the sharding model segments the network various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than validate the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). A beacon chain then performs operations to maintain consensus throughout the network, while also randomizing validators and slashing nodes stake for dishonest behavior. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum’s scalability.",

Underpinning \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e's xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution, XRP is used as a bridge currency for financial institutions exchanging value between multiple fiat currencies. XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open source cryptographic ledger powered by an peer-to-peer network of nodes.",
        "background": "Founded in 2012 by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/chris-larsen\"\u003eChris Larsen\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\"\u003eJed McCaleb\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e (Formerly known as Opencoin) is a technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol. Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger\"\u003eRyan Fugger\u003c/a\u003e, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open source cryptographic ledger powered by an peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz\"\u003eDavid Schwartz\u003c/a\u003e, and Arthur Britto, would join the project and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). \n\nIn 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013 Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.\n\nAfter the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitlicense\"\u003eBitLicense\u003c/a\u003e from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. \n\nToday XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e's xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP a bridge currency for for its liquidity.\n\nTo date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programatically sells on a quarterly basis. Since 2016 Ripple has sold over $1.1 billion worth of XRP and XRP sales remain Ripple's dominant source of revenue (and controversy).\n\n",
        "technology": "XRP's foundation is a shared public ledger used by network participants to exchange value globally. A super majority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network.\n\nRipple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to “ripple” across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. \n\nFor users just getting started, Ripple Inc., maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.\n\nCross currency transactions typically take 3 – 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP’s path finding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the path finding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard. Invoicing and wallet solutions allow businesses to incorporate it as a payment option for their customers.\n",

Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb each received 9.5 billion XRP. Arthur Britto received 1 billion XRP.\n77.8% was allocated to Ripple\n0.2% was airdropped as an experiment to try and expand usage as part of the launch.\n\nIn 2014, Chris Larsen committed 7 billion XRP from his allocation to a charitable foundation. Jed McCaleb donated 2 billion of his allocation to a donor-advised fund. In 2014 McCaleb negotiated an exit agreement from the project dictating his remaining allocation would be held in a custodial account and released to him on a monthly schedule. A daily cap on the amount he can sell of the tokens released is included in the agreement. Today, Ripple’s selling restrictions on co-founder Jed McCaleb allow him to sell his allocation at a theoretical maximum rate of 1% of daily trading volume.\n\n"

Tether is primarily issued on the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains and corresponds on a 1:1 basis with US Dollars sitting in bank accounts.  ",
        "background": "Founded in July 2014 by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/brock-pierce\"\u003eBrock Pierce\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/craig-sellars\"\u003eCraig Sellars\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/reeve-collins\"\u003eReeve Collins\u003c/a\u003e, Tether (USDT), originally known as \"Realcoin\", is a cryptocurrency commonly known as a “\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\"\u003establecoin\u003c/a\u003e” that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the U.S. dollar. Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept to the world in 2012. Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model, and is now the most widely used stablecoin today.\n\nTether was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptocurrency that is fully backed 1:1 by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are represented as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether utilizes the Omni layer, to represent USDT tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/tether-limited\"\u003eTether Ltd\u003c/a\u003e is solely responsible for creating and redeeming tokens as well as maintaining the 1:1 deposit backing. \n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bitfinex\"\u003eBitfinex\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bittrex\"\u003eBittrex\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/binance-holdings-ltd\"\u003eBinance\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/coinbase\"\u003eCoinbase\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/kraken\"\u003eKraken\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/huobi\"\u003eHuobi\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/poloniex\"\u003ePoloniex\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/liquid\"\u003eLiquid.io\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/gate-io\"\u003eGate.io\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/okex\"\u003eOKEx\u003c/a\u003e. Tether Ltd shares many executives and has strong ties with Hong Kong based Bitfinex with both sharing the same parent organization \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ifinex-inc\"\u003eiFinex Inc\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSince its founding in 2014, Tether has been the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/history-of-tether\"\u003esubject of ongoing controversy \u003c/a\u003edue to the failure of Tether to provided audited financial statements proving it has adequate reserves backing USDT. Historically Tether has failed to disclose its banking relationships, only recently announcing its banking partners in November 2018 to quell rumors about its solvency raised by associated crypto exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nIn March 2019, Tether updated its disclosure statement claiming that its tokens are no longer backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits. Tether is instead now backed 100% backed by reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities. ",
        "technology": "Tether relies on a proof-of-reserves system to ensure that reserve assets match circulating tokens. This requires a third-party to audit Tether’s bank accounts on a regular basis to show that U.S. dollar reserves are held in an amount equal to outstanding tokens. Tether uses an IOU issuance model where each USDT represents a claim for $1.00 held in the Tether's reserves which users can redeem at any time.\n\nOn Bitcoin, USDT tokens are issued via the Omni Layer protocol, which is a protocol built as a layer over Bitcoin that allows for the issuance of tokens representing any kind of asset.  \n\nOn Ethereum, USDT tokens are issued using the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/erc-20\"\u003eERC-20\u003c/a\u003e protocol standard for creating tokens on Ethereum. ERC-20 tokens include a common set of rules that define how a token can be transferred, approved and requested. ",

        "overview": "Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hard-fork\"\u003ehard fork\u003c/a\u003e advocating for and building towards a literal interpretation of Bitcoin as a \"peer-to-peer electronic cash system\". It views cheap peer to peer transactions as the core value proposition of the network and is dedicated to increasing block sizes and on-chain transaction throughput in pursuit of this goal. Bitcoin Cash believes that starting as a medium of exchange is the superior route to becoming a money in opposition to Bitcoin's strategy of first optimizing for securely storing value.",
        "background": "As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/block-size\"\u003eblock size\u003c/a\u003e began. However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the “New York Agreement”, where an agreement was reached to support \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e and a 2MB \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\"\u003ehard fork\u003c/a\u003e. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork\"\u003esoft fork\u003c/a\u003e to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nAlthough increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\"\u003enodes\u003c/a\u003e, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. Given such, Bitcoin Cash has planned network upgrades every six months. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash.",
        "technology": "Bitcoin Cash, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 32MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mempool\"\u003emempool\u003c/a\u003e) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin Cash's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\"\u003edifficulty\u003c/a\u003e adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin Cash uses a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work\u003c/a\u003e (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. \n\n",

The project considers itself complementary to Bitcoin as a silver to Bitcoin's gold. It is often used as a pseduo-testnet for Bitcoin, adopting new protocol changes before they are deployed on Bitcoin.",
        "background": "Created in October 2011 by ex Google and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/coinbase\"\u003eCoinbase\u003c/a\u003e engineer, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/charlie-lee\"\u003eCharlie Lee\u003c/a\u003e, Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin's source code that posits itself as \"a silver to Bitcoin's gold.\"  Technically, Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin with key differences relating to block time, supply, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\"\u003ehashing\u003c/a\u003e algorithm, and initial distribution. Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.\n\nNotably, Litecoin implements 2.5 second block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive. Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory intensive hashing algorithm, in order to better allow individuals to mine Litecoin with commodity hardware (although \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\"\u003eASICs\u003c/a\u003e have been developed for Litecoin mining over the past few years). Finally, Charlie Lee, recognizing the mistakes of the few altcoins launched prior to Litecoin, wanted Litecoin to be launched in a fair manner, electing to only do a 150 coin (3 block) premine to allow people to get in early.\n\nCharlie Lee left Coinbase in June 2017 to head the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/litecoin-foundation\"\u003eLitecoin foundation\u003c/a\u003e, which stewards the Litecoin project, and finances Litecoin Core development. ",
        "technology": "Litecoin, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 1MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/mempool\"\u003emempool\u003c/a\u003e) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/double-spending\"\u003edouble-spend\u003c/a\u003e vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\"\u003ehash\u003c/a\u003e less than the target number set by Litecoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Litecoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.",

        "overview": "EOS is an open-source protocol designed by Dan Larimer and Block.one to support the creation of smart contracts and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e. Its network features a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake\"\u003edelegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)\u003c/a\u003e consensus mechanism to help secure the platform while giving it a level of performance desirable for running applications. Through DPoS, EOS offers greater scalability and transaction throughput than traditional blockchain networks, but to a certain extent, it relinquishes complete decentralization and censorship resistance.",
        "background": "EOS was published by software publisher \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/block-one\"\u003eBlock.one\u003c/a\u003e and development is led by CTO \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/dan-larimer\"\u003eDan Larimer\u003c/a\u003e, who founded Steem (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/steem\"\u003e$STEEM\u003c/a\u003e) and BitShares (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitshares\"\u003e$BTS\u003c/a\u003e). The project competes with other popular smart contract platforms such as Ethereum (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003e$ETH\u003c/a\u003e), NEO (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/neo\"\u003e$NEO\u003c/a\u003e), and Cardano (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cardano\"\u003e$ADA\u003c/a\u003e). EOS tries to differentiate itself by providing transaction throughput capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without having to pay direct fees, improved usability for all parties involved, and governance for business and chain maintenance.\n\nEOS makes use of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/on-chain-governance\"\u003eon-chain governance\u003c/a\u003e whereby token holders can vote for the block producers (BPs) as well as various upgrades to the protocol, monetary policy, or stakeholder bylaws. The EOS User Agreement defines and enforces the user bylaws. The rules are not enforceable at the protocol level but rather act as a terms-of-service agreement that users must agree to. This community developed agreement replaced Block.one's Constitution by a majority BP vote back in April 2019.\n\nEcosystem funds play an important role in the growth and adoption of EOS. Their mandate is to make strategic investments that increase the value of the projects and tokens to ensure the necessary infrastructure is built and proper incentivization exists to attract developers to build on the platform. The most prominent is a $325 million fund ran by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/michael-novogratz\"\u003eMike Novogratz\u003c/a\u003e called Galaxy Digital EOS VC.",
        "technology": "Block.one built EOS with scalability as a primary objective. Beyond its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, EOS employs Graphene technology and (in the long-term) parallel processing to maximize performance.\nGraphene technology: An open-course software toolkit developed by Dan Larimer that helps improve transaction processing capabilities. It is currently used by previous Larimer creations, Bitshares and Steem, as well as MUSE and Peerplay.\nParallel computation: Also referred to as horizontal scaling, this technology divides transactions and smart contract execution among multiple processors to help reduce the run time of a program. The first protocol version will operate on a single thread (i.e., a single processor) but will shift to a multithreaded platform in the future.\n\nEOS requires users to obtain the following resources to submit transactions and run decentralized applications:\nCPU: the processing power it takes to operate a dApp and read data from a storage device (measured in microseconds)\nNET: network bandwidth or the average rate of data transfer through the communication protocol (measured in bytes)\nRAM: data storage\n\nEOS holders receive CPU and NET by staking their tokens and receiving a proportional amount of the network resources. As a result, the network utilizes a no direct fee model where tokens give holders access to their pro-rata share of network resources. That being said, any operation needing storage or to create an account requires RAM to be purchased separately.\n\nEOS uses the WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM), which offers high speed and performance as well as support for a multitude of programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust, giving developers access to existing optimization and debugging tools.\n\nAdditionally, EOS implements human-readable names and account recovery solutions at the protocol level. Recovery is made possible with the designation of a recovery party that can reset the owner's keys with their approval. Unlike traditional multi-signature applications, the recovery partner has no control over the account other than helping the owner reset their keys.",

Binance Coin was launched as an\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/erc-20\"\u003e ERC-20 token\u003c/a\u003e sold through an\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003e initial coin offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e to be used for discounted trading fees, of which a portion are burned each quarter. Once Binance launched Binance Chain, its own public blockchain in April 2019, the ERC-20 tokens were swapped for native tokens. On top of Binance Chain, the team built a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\"\u003edecentralized exchange\u003c/a\u003e known as Binance DEX allowing traders to maintain custody of their funds. Over time, additional utility has been added to the token such as use in the Binance Launchpad lottery system and various payments in the Binance ecosystem. In addition, according to their CEO Changpeng Zhao (\"CZ\") 90% of Binance employees choose to receive part of their salary in BNB.",
        "technology": "Binance Coin was originally launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum until April 2019. Binance converted all ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain BNB coins a couple days after the Binance chain mainnet launched. Two months earlier, Binance chain’s testnet launched and was used by the internal Binance team and some high-volume traders for testing. \n\nBinance’s decentralized exchange (DEX) is built on the Binance blockchain using Tendermint and the Cosmos Software Developer Kit (SDK). Binance forked Cosmos to create the Binance blockchain, which currently does not support smart contract features. Binance aims to use the Tendermint consensus framework to solve some interoperability problems with inter-blockchain communication (IBC). \n\nBinance chain source code is currently not open source for competitiveness reasons, according to Binance. But the exchange plans to open source the DEX and blockchain codebases when both products gain more adoption. \n",

Binance Coin’s distribution process had three phases: allocation to founders, allocation to investors, and a public sale.  \nFounders received 80 million BNB (40% of supply) vested over four years. Half of the founders’ allocation was vested immediately. The other half is vested annually through 2021. From Q2 2019, these tokens will be burnt through quarterly burns and will thus remain illiquid until they are burnt.  Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB (50% of supply) over time and has successfully executed nine coin burns to date.\nInvestors receive 20 million BNB (10% of supply) with no vesting or lock-up restrictions. \nThe public sale distributed 100 million BNB (50% of supply). Binance launched the ERC-20 Binance Coin in a public sale on July 14, 2017. Half of the funds raised through Binance’s coin offering were intended for Binance branding and marketing, and roughly one-third of the funds were for platform upgrades and development.\n\nBinance executed the token swap from ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain mainnet BNB coins on April 23, 2019. Binance Coins native to the Binance chain are called BEP2 BNB. Pre-selected validators produced blocks after the genesis block on April 18, 2019, and the first ERC-20 to BEP2 BNB swap of 5 million BNB was executed to a wallet belonging to Binance."

It views cheap peer to peer transactions as the core value proposition of the network and is dedicated to increasing block sizes and on-chain transaction throughput in pursuit of this goal.",
        "background": "Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (BSV) is the result of a perennial debate within certain cryptocurrency circles about what Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for Bitcoin was and if Bitcoin is or should strictly adhere to their vision. BSV's ethos is to \"restore what was the original Bitcoin protocol.\" The decision to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\"\u003ehard fork\u003c/a\u003e from Bitcoin Cash was a result of a dispute over canonical transaction ordering which would enable the graphene algorithm to run more efficiently and script enhancements enabling oracle data to be imported to the blockchain. In opposition, Bitcoin SV rejected these proposals and instead planned to increase the block limit to 128MB (later increased to 512MB in a hard fork) and restore certain opcodes from the original Bitcoin 0.1.0 protocol implementation.  Although increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\"\u003enodes\u003c/a\u003e, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. \n\nOn November 15, 2018, Bitcoin Cash split into two with the Bitcoin ABC faction, the leading Bitcoin Cash client, ultimately winning the majority of the networks hashrate and retaining the name Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin SV is led by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/nchain\"\u003enChain\u003c/a\u003e, a research and development technology firm building tools, protocols, and applications to support blockchain growth worldwide.",
        "technology": "Bitcoin SV, the protocol, is a distributed, time-stamped ledger of unspent transaction output (UTXO) transfers stored in an append-only chain of 512MB data blocks. A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (mempool) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin SV's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin SV uses a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work\u003c/a\u003e (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain.

        "overview": "Stellar is an open-source payments network that serves as a distributed intermediary blockchain for global financial systems and circulates a native asset, Stellar Lumens (XLM). The Stellar blockchain allows anyone to issue new assets in the network and exchange for other assets via built-in asset exchange features. Assets on Stellar are issued and redeemed by anchors, who are trusted entities that issue digital credits on the Stellar network in exchange for deposits of the asset with the trusted entity. Anchors enable real world assets to be exchanged on Stellar by leveraging a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\"\u003edistributed exchange\u003c/a\u003e that maintains an order book for every asset pair. Stellar supports the issuance of any type of asset including stocks, currencies, cryptoassets and more.\n",
        "background": "After leaving \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e in 2013 due to internal conflicts over vision, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\"\u003eJed McCaleb\u003c/a\u003e, along with partner Joyce Kim, forked the Ripple protocol and launched the Stellar project in 2014. With the creation of the non-for profit \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/stellar-development-foundation\"\u003eStellar Development Foundation\u003c/a\u003e (SDF), the team aimed to \"promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion...and create an open and affordable financial system where people of all income levels can access simple-to-use, secure, and low cost financial services.\" The Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Stripe invested $3 million in seed funding and received 2 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) in exchange. At launch the network generated 100 billion XLM and featured a 1% annual issuance rate. \n\nIn 2015, Stellar redesigned its consensus protocol following a ledger fork in 2014 that rolled back hours of transactions. It's new and current consensus protocol called \"Stellar Consensus Protocol\" was developed by Stanford professor \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-mazi-res\"\u003eDavid Mazières\u003c/a\u003e, chief scientist of the SDF. In 2017, Jed McCaleb and Brit Yonge launched \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/interstellar\"\u003eLightyear\u003c/a\u003e as a for-profit entity of Stellar, that would build a universal payment network on Stellar. In 2017, Stellar announced a grants program that would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development.\n\nIn October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\nIn November 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/stellar-development-foundation-burns-more-than-half-of-lumen-supply-with-new-strategy-focus\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e it burned more than 55 billion XLM (~55%) tokens as it moves away from airdrop programs. Previously the foundation had retained 68 billion XLM earmarked for giveaways in order to grow the community. Citing a declining utility from airdrops, the SDF burned 50 billion of those tokens along with 5 billion of the 17 billion previously held in its operating fund. The burn reduced the total supply to 50 billion XLM of which SDF's ownership of the total dropped from XLM supply from 85% to 60%.\n",
        "technology": "The Stellar blockchain consensus mechanism is called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), an implementation of the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.\n\nAn FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on “quorum slices” to reach consensus—subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the “slice.” Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.\n\nTo attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network’s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.\n\nSome of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, Stellar aims to offer faster transactions and lower network fees. All assets on the Stellar blockchain are not traded only by exchanging credits across between accounts in the network that are managed by anchors. ",

Stellar initially stated that the 100 billion XLM issued at the launch of the network in 2015 would be distributed as follows: \n50% would be reserved for the Direct Sign-up Program. The goal of the Direct Sign-up Program was \"to make lumens easily accessible to millions of individuals and communities across the globe\" through airdrops.\n20% would be allocated to the Bitcoin Program. The goal of the Bitcoin Program was \"to encourage bitcoin holders to explore and use Stellar\" by airdropping tokens to Bitcoin addresses. \n25% would be distributed as part of the Partnership Program. The goal of the Partnership Program was \"to encourage adoption and growth of Stellar through the institutional distribution of lumens\" by distributing grants to businesses, governments, institutions, or nonprofit organizations.\n2% would be allocated to Stripe for its seed investment and locked until June 2019.\n3% would be retained by the Stellar Development Foundation for its operational budget\n\nThe Direct Sign-up, Bitcoin and Partnership Program featured an initial distribution plan over a period of 10 years. Nevertheless, the SDF did not manage to distribute those XLM as expected and conducted several changes to its distribution plan and treasury management over the years, as detailed in the Supply Curve details section.

It supports the creation of new tokens and smart contracts (thus decentralized applications or dApps). The on-chain governance system enables token holders to make decisions together and improve the network over time, as opposed to the less-inclusive off-chain governance models used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
        "background": "Tezos founded and on-chain governance design\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/arthur-breitman\"\u003eArthur Breitman\u003c/a\u003e first proposed Tezos in a position paper released in Aug. 2014. He later released a white paper in Sept. 2014 that detailed more specifics about the project. Breitman published both articles under the pseudonym \"L. M Goodman\" akin to Bitcoin's anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. In the documents, the author stressed Bitcoin's design failed to account for a more inclusive governance process and did not facilitate the creation of new tokens. Breitman and his wife \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/kathleen-breitman\"\u003eKathleen\u003c/a\u003e, therefore, designed Tezos as a token issuance and smart contract platform with an \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/on-chain-governance\"\u003eon-chain governance\u003c/a\u003e model, which would allow XTZ holders to vote on proposed protocol upgrades to avoid forking the network.\n\nIn 2015, the Breitmans established a company called Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), which was responsible for writing the initial code for Tezos. At its core, Tezos is a system designed to formalize proposing, voting for, and implementing changes to the functionality of the network. Once a proposal is submitted, holders of Tezos (XTZ) tokens can vote with a weighting of one vote per token. DLS released the source code in 2016 and used the codebase to launch an alphanet of the Tezos protocol in Feb. 2017, a few months before the Tezos token sale.\n\nTezos initial coin offering (ICO) and Foundation troubles\nThe Tezos \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003einitial coin offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e launched on July 1, 2017, and the two-week sale managed to raise ~$232 million in Bitcoin (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003e$BTC\u003c/a\u003e) and Ethereum (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003e$ETH\u003c/a\u003e), exceeding the project's target of $20 million. It was the largest ICO at the time, surpassed by Filecoin's (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/filecoin\"\u003e$FIL\u003c/a\u003e) ~$257 million token sale a few months later. The newly established Tezos Foundation, led by appointed president Johann Gevers, assumed control of the funds as well as the responsibility to deliver the sold tezzies to ICO contributors. The foundation, which did not include the Breitmans as board members for legal reasons, intended to use a portion of the funds to purchase Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS) from the Breitmans, a move that would transfer control of the Tezos codebase to the foundation.\n\nBefore the sale of DLS could take place, an internal dispute arose between the Breitmans and Gevers, leading to a delay in the distribution of XTZ tokens to investors. In response, angry investors launched several class-action lawsuits targeting Tezos and DLT, adding further delays to the protocol's development and token issuance event. The internal dispute ran its course by mid-Feb. 2018, when Gevers and another involved foundation member left their positions.\n\nMainnet launch\nThe foundation's early troubles caused the development team to miss its initial late 2017 launch date. After the resolution, protocol development resumed, enabling the Tezos Foundation to release its betanet in June 2018. After a successful betanet deployment and testing period, the foundation launched the Tezos mainnet in Sept. 2018.\n\nThe launch introduced a new version of a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake (DPoS)\u003c/a\u003e consensus model. Token holders can participate in consensus by locking up their tokens in exchange for the ability to validate blocks. The industry commonly refers to this process as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/staking'\"\u003estaking\u003c/a\u003e, but the Tezos community uses the synonymous term \"baking.\" The Tezos design expands on traditional PoS systems by enabling users to \"delegate\" tokens to bakers without transferring ownership. In this self-described \"liquid\" PoS model, a baker receives a block reward in the form of new XTZ tokens with a proportional amount of this reward distributed to users that delegated tokens to the baker. This system enables smaller token holders to participate in the validation (and reward) process if they hold less than the required amount to become a full baker.",
        "technology": "Tezos is a multi-purpose blockchain platform that integrates features like \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/on-chain-governance\"\u003eon-chain governance\u003c/a\u003e, and the ability to conduct formal verification. The developers made a unique choice to use OCaml as the programming language arguing that it offers better security features and is a more powerful interface compared to other options like C++. OCaml also allows developers to check operations using formal verification which can detect potential bugs or errors in the code. \n\nTo allow for future changes to the network Tezos is divided into network, transaction, and consensus protocols. The transaction and consensus protocols operate separately and plug into a generic network shell. This shell maintains the current state of the blockchain and allows the network to conduct internal checks on the protocols allowing them to validate their own replacements. Proposed changes can be made by anyone and are decided on by a vote from token holders. Proposals can include a payment to be made by the developer proposing a change that the team believes will incentive more impactful development on the platform.\n\nTezos uses a variation of a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake (PoS)\u003c/a\u003e system that differs slightly from established models in that block producers are not selected by token holders and anyone can participate as a baker (validator) if they hold a specified amount of tokens. Token holders that do not meet the minimum threshold can delegate their tokens to a baker without needing to relinquish control of their tokens. Using this model the team believes they can increase participation from token holders by reducing frictions and allowing anyone to receive newly released XTZ to maintain the relative value of their holdings.",

The Foundation has half of its XTZ in a vesting smart contract and another half is reserved for DLS when certain milestones are met. When those milestones are met those tokens will be moved into a vesting smart contract for DLS. Until that time the Foundation will use some of these reserved tokens internally as part of the deposit needed for baking."

        "overview": "TRON is a multi-purpose blockchain platform aimed at the entertainment industry with smart contracts and the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). In 2018 TRON acquired BitTorrent and launched the BTT token.",
        "background": "Tron is a decentralized entertainment-focused blockchain and content-sharing platform. In 2018, the project purchased file sharing service BitTorrent in order to expand its product. Tron is a long-term project with a set of 6 phases. \n\nExodus: building the free platform for peer to peer distribution, storage, and content. Exodus’ goal is to provide a simple distributed file sharing built on something similar to IPFS. \nOdyssey: introducing financial incentives to encourage content creation. Odyssey is supposed to incentivize early adopters and foster the growth of a community consisting of content creators and consumers. Reimbursement for creation will be through a tipping scheme, instead of views and clicks - as those methods can be easily exploited through bots.\nGreat Voyage: launching TRON-native ICO capability. Tron looks to allow content creators to offer a stake in a potential personal brand through individual ICOs or branded tokens. \nApollo: enable content producers to issue personal tokens\nStar Trek: brings a decentralized gaming and forecasting platform.\nEternity: aim for further decentralization of the gaming industry. This phase aims to bring the ability to fund-raise and monetize based on community growth. \n\nEventually, Tron’s core technology will be based on the adaptation of IPFS and Ethereum’s platform. In short, what Tron is trying to create is a huge mixture of what is already being done by other projects. Relatedly, Tron is criticized for plagiarism regarding its white paper. Founder Justin Sun tweeted that the translation was done by volunteers and excused it as carelessness on the part of translators.\n",
        "technology": "Tron relies on consensus through a delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol allows approximately 1000 transactions per second and supports smart contracts written in Java, Python, and other common programming languages. A total of 27 \"super representatives\" are responsible for validating blocks on the network. Super representatives are chosen through a voting system that allows users to vote based on the tokens that they hold.\n\nTron’s chain has a 3-tiered architecture: the storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The storage layer adopts a distributed protocol branched into block storage and state storage. Its underlying storage layer uses the graph database to manage data storage, which aims to manage data storage as Tron not only stores the node data but also inter-node connections. Its middle layer is composed of modules of smart contracts, account management, consensus and more. \n\nTronix (TRX) is the official name for the native Tron token. Miners earn TRX by providing data storage space to network users. Tron intends to be used as market model rather than a cloud model. Tron expects TRX tokens to act as a mediator between consumers and content creators without the need for token exchanges. It was initially an ERC20 token. On June 24th, 2018, Tron migrated from Ethereum protocol to TRON MainNet in a one-to-one swap. \n",

        "overview": "Cardano is a smart-contract based platform that aims to provide multiple features through layered design and modularity. ",
        "background": "Cardano is an open-source blockchain originating from peer-reviewed academic research, according to the team. Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers. Cardano sees itself as a “third-generation” protocol, improving on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively. Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. \n\nCardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. \n\nCardano is developed in five phases:\nByron: the bootstrap era where the network is only operated by designated peers and block rewards are burned\nShelly: the phase for a transition away from trusted nodes to a public network but protocol development will still be centralized\nGoguen: the phase for delivering sidechain and smart contract capabilities \nBasho: the phase focused on settlement and computation layer performance improvements\nVoltaire: the phase for introducing a treasury and governance system",
        "technology": "The Cardano blockchain has two layers: a settlement layer and a computation layer. The Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) serves to settle transactions made by peers in the network with ADA, Cardano’s native currency. The Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) is optimized to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. Cardano developers chose a layered protocol to increase the network’s capacity for protocol changes and soft fork implementations. Cardano is developed in Haskell and Cardano smart contracts are created in Plutus, another programming language that allows for building stricter contracts.\n\nCardano uses a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake (PoS)\u003c/a\u003e consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. Ouroboros consensus aims for improved network security and modularized design. Cardano’s modularization allows for network delegation, sidechains, improved light client data structures, and more.\n\nOuroboros consensus is determined by slot leaders who are elected by token holders with a sufficient stake in the network. Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardano input endorser is the second set of stakeholders that verifies transactions included in blocks. Cardano believes this design is highly scalable since the network ca increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.",

Where by anybody can propose ideas which are funded when accepted via donations to the forum funding system. With funds being released when milestones are achieved. \n",
        "technology": "Monero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called CryptoNight, which is friendly toward CPU and GPU mining. New blocks are added to the chain on average every two minutes. Mining difficulty adjusts after each new block. To maintain friendliness to CPU and GPU miners Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to disrupt the operations of ASIC miners. Generally, making upgrades to the protocol at the same time.\n\nMonero's privacy enhancements come from CryptoNote which masks sender identities via ring signature mixing and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero’s blockchain.\n\nIncluding past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. At times, questions have arisen regarding how indistinguishable historical transactions really are since they are tied to Monero’s blockchain. To alleviate these concerns the hard fork of March 9, 2019 included protocol upgrades increasing the opaqueness of historical transactions.\n\nTo verify the output of transactions Monero uses key images. Key images are posted to the Monero blockchain once a transaction is complete. Ensuring miners can verify no coins are double spent by confirming a transactions key image has not been previously used. Key images are cryptographically secured and cannot be used to identify which output created the image.\n\nTo support its ecosystem Monero has built out a fully featured wallet. Making it easy for users to set up nodes, mine, or transact across the network.\n",

LINK is decentralized oracle middleware usable by any type of smart contract platform for providing and receiving secure access to external data. Participants spend and receive LINK for oracles access and support.\n\nLINK is a SmartContract.com developed by a team with more than three years of experience building and securing oracles for Bitcoin and Ethereum networks via partnerships with SWIFT to utilize the SWIFT messaging system. LINK also partners with Cornell’s IC3 to launch the first Intel SGX secured link between smart contracts and secure external data.\n\nLINK’s oracle solution builds a network of data providers who offer accurate data for smart contract inputs. Because LINK is decentralized, chosen data feeds and oracles will be randomized based on internal reputation score and mathematical accuracy proofs. LINK also aims to securely execute smart contracts dependent on a particular piece of data, rewarding contract participants with appropriate ethers or satoshis, for example.",
        "technology": "LINK’s decentralized network of introduces three approaches to ensuring against faulty data inputs and ameliorate other vulnerabilities associated with single trusted oracles.\n\nDistributing data sources and curating verified data via majority voting prevents reliance on a single data sources. LNIK also distributes oracle selection by aggregating oracle data and ordering historical oracle trustworthiness. Third, LINK introduces hardware components like Intel’s Software Guard eXtensions to protect the integrity and confidentiality of supporting applications.\n\nChainLink also introduces a reputation and certification system to catalog and display oracle performance for user evaluation. Oracle security profiles include number of assigned requests, number of completed requests, average response time, etc. LINK is used to pay node operators for data retrieval from off-chain feeds, formatting data into blockchain-readable formats, and good data-retrieval up time.\n\nLINK was originally built on Ethereum with plans to interact with all smart contract networks like EOS, HyperLedger and RootStock.",

        "background": "NEO, originally named Antshares and sometimes called the \"Chinese Ethereum\", is China's first open-source blockchain platform developed to facilitate the easy construction of a digital economy complete with digital identities, assets, contracts, and payments. Founders Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang aim to offer a more-easily scalable, versatile platform that supports a panoply of programming languages, which are compiled in a secure executable environment called NEO Virtual Machine (NeoVM).\n\nNEO aims to compete with Ethereum and other projects that position themselves as developer-friendly decentralized protocols to launch a strong foundation for a future digitized \"smart\" economy. NEO also aims to implement features like quantum-computing resistance and inter-chain operability for the most competitive a distributed \"smart economy\" network. ",
        "technology": "NEO's virtual machine code compiler is designed to support a sizable list of languages including: C#, Java, C, C++, GO, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. NeoVM is a lightweight, general-purpose virtual machine that is intended to support small programs (e.g. smart contracts) or can be ported into non-blockchain systems. \n\nNEO's goals of cross-chain interchangeability features come from NeoX, a protocol that supports cross-chain asset exchange and distributed transactions, which is to say it aims for consistency and executability of transactions across multiple protocols. \n\nFor its consensus mechanism, NEO relies on delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT), which can support up to 10,000 transactions per second. Validating nodes are randomly selected to confirm on-chain transactions by a collective of book-keeping nodes, which mimics the consensus mechanism of protocols like Stellar in some ways. Chain hard forks are more more complicated under dBFT consensus than Proof of Work (PoW), for example. Users cannot fork the chain at will like under PoW consensus since dBFT requires a two-thirds user majority to operate. \n\nNEO also supports two native tokens: NEO and NeoGas (GAS). NEO is a payments token that also confers governance rights over the network's changes and development. GAS is a fuel token for the NEO virtual machine useful for executing smart contracts and supporting applications built on NEO. ",

It views some key obstacles to these goals as status quo inefficiency, limited performance, and ad hoc governance styles. To correct these concerns, Cosmos was created as a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains, creating the foundation for a new token economy. \n\nThe ideal solution, according to Cosmos, is to build a tool for interacting with multiple parallel blockchains such that the relative, unique value of a given chain's features are exploitable on any other chain. In essence, a layered network connecting existing chains and sync activity and growth in the blockchain space. \n\nThe Cosmos SDK is a developer-friendly, modular framework, each powered by a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/byzantine-general-s-problem\"\u003eByzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT)\u003c/a\u003e consensus algorithm such as Tendermint Core, allowing developers to fully customize their decentralized applications and focus on business logic. ",
        "technology": "Cosmos is designed to operate as a network of \"zones\" and \"hubs\". Zone simply references a network of many independent blockchains connected under Cosmos. Their interaction is powered by Tendermint Core, a secure consensus protocol easily adaptable with \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake (PoS)\u003c/a\u003e blockchains. The first Cosmos zone is called a hub, a Proof-of-Stake environment for multiple cryptocurrency assets. The hub is also albe to interface with other subsequent zones via Cosmos' inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol. ",

          "description": "The Interchain Foundation defined 4 categories of contributions to the development and launch of the Cosmos Network: Private Contributors, Public Contributors, All in Bits Inc (AiB), and the Interchain Foundation (ICF).\nThe strategic and early contributors contributed an amount of USD 1,329,472.33 at a discount from the public fundraiser's USD/ATOM rate (discounts ranged from 15-25%), prior to the public fundraiser. They received 16,856,718.97 ATOMs.\nThe seed contributors contributed an amount of USD 300,000. They received 11,809,947.91 ATOMs.\nPublic contributors consisted of public members of the Tendermint and Cosmos community that participated in the fundraiser on April 6th, 2017. A total amount of 16,029,305.06 USD was contributed by 864 addresses, at a rate of USD 0.10/ATOM.\nAiB received 10% of the total genesis ATOM allocation for developing the open-source IP that underlies the Cosmos Network. This equals a total of 23,619,895.81 ATOMs. AiBs ATOMs are split into two sets, each subject to a different form of vesting. The first set consists of 1,777,707 ATOMs allocated to 44 addresses owned by AiB founders, contractors, and employees. These atoms are non-transferable for 12 months but can be used for staking and governance. The remaining set of AiBs atoms are held in an AiB multisig and vest continuously for 22 months starting 2 months after genesis.\nICF received 10% of the total genesis ATOM allocation to support its mandate of R\u0026D for open and decentralized networks, with particular focus on the Cosmos Network and the Cosmos Project in general. This is a total of 23,619,895.81 ATOMs. ICF ATOMs are split into three sets - all are unrestricted and not subject to a vesting schedule. The first set is for advisors and early contributors to organizing the fundraiser and foundation structure, a total of 3,054,207.32 ATOMs allocated to 8 addresses. The second set is for the so-called Game-of-Stakes participants, according to the scoring criteria set out by AiB. This is a total of 288,500 ATOMs allocated to 53 addresses. The final set of ICF atoms are held in an ICF multisig. This is a total of 20,277,188.49 ATOMs split between two distinct multisig addresses controlled by the ICF.\n\nIn total, 236,198,958.12 ATOMs were allocated at genesis to 984 accounts."

Because these devices are generally specialized to be low power and perform only specific functions IOTA does not use a traditional consensus mechanism like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake nor does it use a blockchain structure. The goal of the project is to allow these devices to conduct micropayment transactions between themselves and potentially to securely transfer data. \n\nAt the core of the project is what is referred to as the 'Tangle,' a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that acts as the public ledger system. The team believes that this structure will allow for feeless payments, lower compute cost, and the ability to connect to billions of devices. The efficiency of this system also grows as the number of participants increases as transactions will be processed at a faster rate. One of the project's more recent releases was a data marketplace that allows for storing and selling data streams while masking the source of the data.",
        "technology": "IOTA relies on a DAG system to conduct transactions and exchange data. There is no network-wide consensus but instead local approvals between peers. In order to conduct a transaction on the network users must first verify two pending transactions on the network. Compared to other consensus mechanisms this can lead to faster transactions and lower compute cost for verification. Because IOTA uses a unique network structure and implemented its own custom-built cryptographic functions concerns have been raised around the security of the network. 1 IOTA also focuses on enabling offline transactions as part of the team's efforts to reduce the network's resource requirements relative to other blockchain protocols.",
